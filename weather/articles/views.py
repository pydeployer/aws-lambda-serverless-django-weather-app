Wear lightweight, light-colored, and loose-fitting clothing made from breathable fabrics like cotton or moisture-wicking materials. Schedule outdoor activities during cooler parts of the day - early morning or evening hours are ideal. Stay hydrated by drinking water regularly, even if you don\'t feel thirsty. Avoid caffeine and alcohol as they can contribute to dehydration. If you must be outside during peak heat hours, take frequent breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas.'
